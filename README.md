## Introduction

Outside of the so-called [Application Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer), so much of the way computers and servers now work has been moved away from in-house teams and specialists and onto "the cloud" that terms like DevOps have become standard among recruiters, companies, and developers themselves. In other words, concepts of the day now revolve entirely around things like automation, APIs, cloud services, and so forth -- a phenomemon we might refer to as Web 3.0.

While this is surely quite exciting, there is now a massive disconnect between emerging technologies and services and typical small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) and independent teams who face an impossible learning curve to maintain not only a competitive edge, but to even keep up with basic standards in security, etc.

The idea behind SlickStack is that while "the wheel" might not need re-inventing, it surely [can be improved](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/greener-tires/). While Silicon Valley bigwigs and corporate players pump out new terms and services on a daily basis -- like Configuration Management (CM) -- the typical small business website is still trying to figure out how to make their contact forms work correctly.

## The Basics

Much of modern computing history can be traced back to one thing: [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).
