<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Clearing caches can now be done using the <strong>Clear Caches</strong> drop-down menu in the top-right of the WP Admin Toolbar above. You can either clear "all caches" or clear them one-by-one (for geeky developers). In most cases, clearing only the Nginx (server/page) cache should be sufficient. If this confuses you, don't worry, because the various caches clear themselves automatically after a while anyway. In certain cases, you might also need to clear the CloudFlare CDN cache as well to "purge" the old files (e.g. images, CSS, and JS files) using the <strong>CloudFlare</strong> drop-down menu. If you want to temporarily disable the CloudFlare cache for 3 hours, you can also enable "Dev" mode instead (not needed in most cases).</p>
<p>We hope you are enjoying our recent backend improvements! Please contact us with any questions or feedback.</p>
<p><em>This message will disappear automatically after a few days, thank you.</em></p>
