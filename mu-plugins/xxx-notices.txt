<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Due to ongoing database thrashing and failure to scale, the plugins <strong>401 To 301</strong> and <strong>Redirection</strong> will be disallowed on February 8, 2019 (end of this week). If you use either of these plugins, please move your 301 redirects to a lighter, more efficient plugin such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/" target="_blank">Simple 301 Redirects</a> (free) that does not log thousands of 404 errors to the WordPress database. This type of 404 logging can be done easily off-server using free tools like Google GSC Webmaster Tools, and is much more accurate too, since it is done "above" the PHP/WordPress level of the server. You can also try the free plugin <a href="https://github.com/littlebizzy/404-to-homepage" target="_blank">404 To Homepage</a> for a quick and easy way to redirect tons of junk URLs generated by abusive robots; this plugin will resolve all potential 404 warnings in Google GSC as well (recommended for most small or medium size websites, but not high traffic news/viral websites per se).</p>
<p><em>This message will disappear automatically after a few days, thank you.</em></p>
